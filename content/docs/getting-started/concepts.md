## Node
Nodes are the backbone of marzneshin. Proxy backends are ran on nodes to keep users connected to the free internet.
Each node has a set of [inbounds](#inbound)

## Inbound
An inbound is the gateway for users into using your nodes.

## Host
Hosts hold the necessary information for your users to find and connect to the inbounds they have access to.

## Service
Services allow you to manage what inbounds are accessible for your users.
They are the first entity you have to create after installing marzneshin.
